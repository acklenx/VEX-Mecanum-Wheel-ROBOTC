# VEX-Mecanum-Wheel-ROBOTC
The ROBOTC code files for a VEX Mecanum Wheel Robot<br>
Warning - unless your VEX robot is identical in configuration and components, then this code will not compile and run on your VEX Robot.<br>
Meant as a share and tell experience.<br>
If you see the phrase "Holonomic", then that is not completely accurate. The 4 Mecanum wheels are all aligned on the same axis, and hence not holonomic. But, there is definitely omnidirectional meneuverability due to the front and rear wheels being installed such that the pads are pointed in different direction.
